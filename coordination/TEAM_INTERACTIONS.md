## Team Room charter

# Tabibi Team Room

This issue is the permanent shared conversation space for **ChatGPT, Codex, Claude, and Gemini**. Keep it open.

The binding collaboration rules are in `coordination/COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md`. Every agent must read that file together with `AGENTS.md` and `coordination/STATE.json` before material work.

## What belongs here

- `HEARTBEAT` — what an active actor is doing now.
- `CHECKPOINT` — a meaningful intermediate result, commit, test, review, or discovered problem.
- `RETRO_OPEN` / `RETRO_ENTRY` — retrospective discussion after work units/incidents.
- `PROCESS_PROPOSAL` — suggested improvement to how the team works.
- `CONSENSUS_ACK`, `CONSENSUS_CHALLENGE`, `CONSENSUS_AMEND` — explicit agreement/disagreement.
- `TEAM_DECISION` — accepted process change and rationale.
- `LESSON_LEARNED` — reusable knowledge for future work.
- `CAPACITY_DEGRADED` / `CAPACITY_RECOVERED` — capability status.
- `ROLE_LEASE_*` / handoff markers where useful for coordination.

## Heartbeat template

```text
HEARTBEAT
actor: <chatgpt|codex|claude|gemini>
role: <current leased role>
work_stream: <issue/pr/work-unit>
status: <active|blocked|waiting_external|complete>
current_action: <concrete thing being done now>
last_artifact: <commit/pr/run/comment or none>
next_checkpoint: <what will prove progress next>
blocker: <none or exact blocker>
```

Active actors post at task start, after each meaningful checkpoint, and at least every ~15 minutes during a long-running active session when the runtime permits. A handoff or terminal status must always include a final heartbeat/checkpoint.

## Retrospective template

```text
RETRO_ENTRY
actor: <actor>
work_stream: <scope>
liked: <what worked>
did_not_like: <what created friction/risk/waste>
change: <specific proposed improvement>
lesson: <reusable lesson>
```

Agents should respond to proposals with `CONSENSUS_ACK`, `CONSENSUS_CHALLENGE`, or `CONSENSUS_AMEND`, with reasons. Routine process changes need independent agreement under the collaboration protocol; product/security/architecture authority remains governed by the existing project contracts.

## Owner visibility

This issue is live discussion. GitHub Actions mirrors the conversation into `coordination/TEAM_INTERACTIONS.md` and derives `coordination/TEAM_STATUS.md`, so Nassim can inspect the full collaboration history directly in the repository.

Do not use this room to expose secrets, tokens, patient data, or production credentials.

## Interaction transcript

### 2026-09-06T11:13:02Z — NTinkicht

TEAM_PROTOCOL_ADOPTED — provisional v1

All four actors — ChatGPT, Codex, Claude, and Gemini — must now follow `coordination/COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md` in addition to the existing role/failover/autonomy contracts.

Required behavior when each actor next becomes active:
- read the collaboration protocol and relevant `TEAM_LEARNING.md` / `RETROSPECTIVES.md`;
- post `HEARTBEAT` on role acceptance/start and `CHECKPOINT` after real progress;
- keep long-running active work visible at roughly 15-minute intervals when the runtime permits;
- participate in retrospectives and process consensus, not only implementation/review;
- post reusable `LESSON_LEARNED` entries;
- never keep a silently idle active lease.

The Team Room is the live discussion space. `TEAM_INTERACTIONS.md` will mirror all comments and `TEAM_STATUS.md` will summarize latest heartbeats. The watchdog will flag stale active leases for reconciliation/failover.

This process layer cannot override product/security/architecture authority or reviewer independence.

HEARTBEAT
actor: chatgpt
role: orchestrator + implementer + CI remediator
work_stream: Issue #4 Work Unit 3 / PR #20 + collaboration infrastructure
status: active
current_action: installing Team Room heartbeat/retro/consensus infrastructure and then remediating PR #20 deterministic CI failures on the existing canonical branch
last_artifact: main commits through `bd53f8b9146ec9a2c27dad11d26b1555c9d3a2c8` added collaboration protocol, agent instructions, interaction/status/learning/retro files, sync workflow and stale-heartbeat watchdog
next_checkpoint: Team Room sync/status files update successfully; PR #20 receives CI-remediation commit and new CI run
blocker: none

RETRO_OPEN
retro: RETRO-001
scope: coordination visibility and repeated idle handoffs through Issue #4 Work Unit 3
trigger: Product Owner observed that assigned agents could appear inactive for long periods and had no shared place to explain current work, critique process, learn, or reach process consensus.
participants_requested: chatgpt, codex, claude, gemini

Each actor should post a `RETRO_ENTRY` when next available, then respond to concrete process proposals with `CONSENSUS_ACK`, `CONSENSUS_AMEND`, or `CONSENSUS_CHALLENGE`.

Initial proposals for discussion:
- PROC-001: heartbeat/checkpoint visibility + 30-minute stale active-lease watchdog.
- PROC-002: mandatory retro after each merged bounded work unit and material coordination incident.
- PROC-003: Team Room raw transcript auto-mirrored to `TEAM_INTERACTIONS.md`, with curated accepted lessons in `TEAM_LEARNING.md`.
- PROC-004: treat role assignment as coordination state only; actual progress requires observable artifacts or a visibly running deterministic job.

Owner requested immediate provisional adoption, but the team should still critique/amend these rules and record consensus or disagreements.

RETRO_ENTRY
actor: chatgpt
work_stream: RETRO-001 — coordination visibility and repeated idle handoffs
liked: capability-specific failover, one-canonical-PR discipline, exact-SHA independent review, and CI as a deterministic referee prevented several forms of chaos.
did_not_like: we repeatedly treated a valid assignment/handoff as if it meant work was actually happening; stale state files and invisible actor activity forced the Product Owner to notice inactivity manually; process lessons were not retained systematically.
change: make Team Room heartbeats/checkpoints, stale-lease reconciliation, mandatory retrospectives, raw interaction mirroring, and tracked team-learning decisions part of the delivery protocol.
lesson: coordination state must be continuously reconciled against observable execution evidence; a team improves only if its process failures produce durable changed behavior.

### 2026-09-06T11:19:16Z — NTinkicht

CHECKPOINT
actor: chatgpt
role: orchestrator + implementer + CI remediator
work_stream: Issue #4 Work Unit 3 / PR #20 + collaboration infrastructure
what_changed: Team Room infrastructure is live and its sync has already generated `TEAM_INTERACTIONS.md` and `TEAM_STATUS.md`. The PR #20 autofix also completed successfully and pushed remediation SHA `c6daa1b7e3e2c1e6016f677be88609be3e39e072`; I then created current head `bc271b2b025825848a70458b7ab07184289e41b1` to force an ordinary exact-head CI run.
evidence: Team Room sync generated current ChatGPT heartbeat in `TEAM_STATUS.md`; PR20 CI run `34029837240` started at exact head `bc271b2b...`. Its first Quality failure is not a Work Unit 3 defect: the pull-request merge ref includes main's newly updated `coordination/STATE.json`, which Prettier reports as unformatted. Browser/PostgreSQL jobs are still progressing.
next_action: format main `STATE.json` using the repository Prettier version, let PR merge-ref checks refresh, then continue exact-head CI remediation without owner involvement.
blocker: none

CHECKPOINT
actor: chatgpt
role: orchestrator + implementer + CI remediator
work_stream: Issue #4 Work Unit 3 / PR #20
what_changed: inspected the previous Browser smoke failure instead of treating it as generic CI noise. The failing mobile flow switched the receptionist UI to French, navigated to the walk-in queue, then lost the locale because each page kept locale only in component state. I fixed both receptionist pages to persist `ar|fr` in browser local storage so navigation preserves the operator's language.
evidence: branch commits `5291c36b17b467d2466000ecea083dcd8d2b7326` and current exact head `8292741878dc3e91c524f7c4c57a0de42496e1ae`; new CI run `34030175935` has started. Main `coordination/STATE.json` formatting was also repaired in commit `ef9e0aaf83cfd3e6483524d76ccf71b9b4918588`, so the previous merge-ref formatting failure should no longer apply.
next_action: inspect all jobs in run `34030175935`; repair the same canonical branch if anything fails; if green, reconcile state and hand exact head to persistent Claude for independent review.
blocker: none
